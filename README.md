# Resume Builder
A simple HTML page for building template resumes. I should probably add a checklist on what needs to be implemented.

# Ranking
A simple HTML page that tries to "Quick Sort" a list of data that you give it. Splits the Inital list, you decide which datapoints are more important compared to a midpoint, repeat previous step until the list is small enough, and then, you rank each one before it spits the final list out. Tested on datasets of atleast 10, the JavaScript is really bad.
